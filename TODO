* Pages take about 10sec longer to load when no network connection is available (possibly waiting on GMaps or Facebook)
* Facebook connect button doesn't show up in signin popup
* Signup form doesn't work right due to some problem with the form_for tag
* Deal description should show when mousing over deal image or thumbs up/down buttons - doesn't show at all when anything moused over now
