* Signup: should carryover history of liked/disliked deals
* Signup: if passwords do not match, the page redirects to the backend rather than showing an error in the form
* Try it/My Deals: Deal description should show when mousing over deal image or thumbs up/down buttons
* My Deals/Search: Category navigation bar highlights the wrong category after clicking (deals shown are right category, but orange highlighted element is the wrong one, ex: clicking Food highlights Beauty/Spa)
* Search: should search business name as well as deal title and show results in order of distance from the location entered
* Pages take about 10sec longer to load when no network connection is available (possibly waiting on GMaps or Facebook) - need this fixed for demoing purposes
