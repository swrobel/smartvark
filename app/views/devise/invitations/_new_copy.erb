<p>We can only activate a limited number of users each day, so here's a challenge:</p>
<p>We've created a personalized invitation link for you to share. If 3 people sign up using that link, your account will be activated.</p>
<% invited = User.where(:invited_by_id => current_user.id) %>
<% if invited.count > 0 %>
  <% signed_up = invited.where(:invitation_token => nil).count %>
  <p>
    You have invited <strong><%= invited.count %></strong> people and <strong><%= signed_up %></strong> of them have signed up. 
    <% if signed_up < 3 %>
      Only <strong><%= 3 - signed_up %></strong> more to go!
    <% end %>
  </p>
<% end %>
